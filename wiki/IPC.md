You can communicate with the running niri instance over an IPC socket.
Check `niri msg --help` for available commands.

The `--json` flag prints the response in JSON, rather than formatted.
For example, `niri msg --json outputs`.

For programmatic access, check the [niri-ipc sub-crate](./niri-ipc/) which defines the types.
The communication over the IPC socket happens in JSON.

> [!TIP]
> If you're getting parsing errors from `niri msg` after upgrading niri, make sure that you've restarted niri itself.
> You might be trying to run a newer `niri msg` against an older `niri` compositor.

### Event Stream

<sup>Since: 0.1.9</sup>

While most niri IPC requests return a single response, the event stream request will make niri continuously stream events into the IPC connection until it is closed.
This is useful for implementing various bars and indicators that update as soon as something happens, without continuous polling.

The event stream IPC is designed to give you the complete current state up-front, then follow up with updates to that state.
This way, your state can never "desync" from niri, and you don't need to make any other IPC information requests.

Where reasonable, event stream state updates are atomic, though this is not always the case.
For example, a window may end up with a workspace id for a workspace that had already been removed.
This can happen if the corresponding workspaces-changed event arrives before the corresponding window-changed event.

To get a taste of the events, run `niri msg event-stream`.
Though, this is more of a debug function than anything.
You can get raw events from `niri msg --json event-stream`, or by connecting to the niri socket and requesting an event stream manually.

You can find the full list of events along with documentation in the [niri-ipc sub-crate](./niri-ipc/).

### Backwards Compatibility

The JSON output *should* remain stable, as in:

- existing fields and enum variants should not be renamed
- non-optional existing fields should not be removed

However, new fields and enum variants will be added, so you should handle unknown fields or variants gracefully where reasonable.

I am not 100% committing to the stability yet because there aren't many users, and there might be something basic I had missed in the JSON output design.

The formatted/human-readable output (i.e. without `--json` flag) is **not** considered stable.
Please prefer the JSON output for scripts, since I reserve the right to make any changes to the human-readable output.

The `niri-ipc` sub-crate (like other niri sub-crates) is *not* API-stable in terms of the Rust semver; rather, it follows the version of niri itself.
In particular, new struct fields and enum variants will be added.
