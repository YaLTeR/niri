To avoid conflicts with an already running compositor, niri won't expose accessibility interfaces when started as a nested window, or as a plain <code>/usr/bin/niri</code> on a TTY.</p> <p>We implement the <code>org.freedesktop.a11y.KeyboardMonitor</code> D-Bus interface for Orca to listen and grab keyboard keys, and we expose the main niri UI elements via AccessKit. Specifically, niri will announce:</p> <ul> <li>workspace switching, for example it'll say \"Workspace 2\" when you switch to the second workspace;</li> <li>the exit confirmation dialog (appears on SuperShiftE by default);</li> <li>Since: 25.11 niri has an AltTab window switcher where it will announce the selected window title;</li> <li>entering the screenshot UI and the overview (niri will say when these are focused, nothing else for now);</li> <li>whenever a config parse error occurs;</li> <li>the important hotkeys list (for now, as one big announcement without tab navigation; appears on SuperShift/ by default).</li> </ul> <p>Here's a demo video, watch with sound on.</p>   https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afceba6f-79f1-47ec-b859-a0fcb7f8eae3   <p>Make sure Xwayland works, then run <code>orca</code>. The default config binds SuperAltS to toggle Orca, which is the standard key binding.</p> <p>Note that there are some limitations:</p> <ul> <li>We don't have a bind to move focus to layer-shell panels. This is not hard to add, but it would be good to have some consensus or prior art with LXQt/Xfce on how exactly this should work.</li> <li>You need to have a screen connected and enabled. Without a screen, niri won't give focus any window. This makes sense for sighted users, and I'm not entirely sure what makes the most sense for accessibility purposes (maybe, it'd be better solved with virtual monitors).</li> <li>You need working EGL (hardware acceleration).</li> <li>We don't have screen curtain functionality yet.</li> </ul> <p>If you're shipping niri and would like to make it work better for screen readers out of the box, consider the following changes to the default niri config:</p> <ul> <li>Change the default terminal from Alacritty to one that supports screen readers. For example, GNOME Console or GNOME Terminal should work well.</li> <li>Change the default application launcher and screen locker to ones that support screen readers. For example, xfce4-appfinder is an accessible launcher. Suggestions welcome! Likely, something GTK-based will work fine.</li> <li>Add some <code>spawn-at-startup</code> command that plays a sound which will indicate to users that niri has finished loading.</li> <li>Add <code>spawn-at-startup \"orca\"</code> to run Orca automatically at niri startup.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Accessibility.html#desktop-zoom","title":"Desktop zoom","text":"<p>There's no built-in zoom yet, but you can use third-party utilities like wooz.</p>"},{"location":"Application-Issues.html","title":"Application-Specific Issues","text":""},{"location":"Application-Issues.html#electron-applications","title":"Electron applications","text":"<p>Electron-based applications can run directly on Wayland, but it's not the default.</p> <p>For Electron \u2265 39, you can use the command-line flag if the app does not default to Wayland: <pre><code>--ozone-platform=wayland\n</code></pre></p> <p>For Electron &lt; 39, you can set an environment variable: <pre><code>environment {\n    ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT \"auto\"\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>For Electron \u2264 28, you need to pass command-line flags to the target application: <pre><code>--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform-hint=auto\n</code></pre></p> <p>If the application has a desktop entry, you can put the command-line arguments into the <code>Exec</code> section.</p>"},{"location":"Application-Issues.html#vscode","title":"VSCode","text":"<p>If you're having issues with some VSCode hotkeys, try starting <code>Xwayland</code> and setting the <code>DISPLAY=:0</code> environment variable for VSCode.

Other game launchers such as Lutris have their own ways of setting gamescope options.</p> <p>Running X11-based games with this method doesn't require Xwayland as gamescope creates its own Xwayland server.

For example:</p> <pre><code>binds {\n    Mod+Left { focus-column-left; }\n    Super+Alt+L { spawn \"swaylock\"; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The hotkey consists of modifiers separated by <code>+</code> signs, followed by an XKB key name in the end.</p> <p>Valid modifiers are:</p> <ul> <li><code>Ctrl</code> or <code>Control</code>;</li> <li><code>Shift</code>;</li> <li><code>Alt</code>;</li> <li><code>Super</code> or <code>Win</code>;</li> <li><code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code> or <code>Mod5</code>\u2014this is the AltGr key on certain layouts;</li> <li><code>ISO_Level5_Shift</code>: can be used with an xkb lv5 option like <code>lv5:caps_switch</code>;</li> <li><code>Mod</code>.</li> </ul> <p><code>Mod</code> is a special modifier that is equal to <code>Super</code> when running niri on a TTY, and to <code>Alt</code> when running niri as a nested winit window. This way, you can test niri in a window without causing too many conflicts with the host compositor's key bindings. For this reason, most of the default keys use the <code>Mod</code> modifier.</p> <p>Since: 25.05 You can customize the <code>Mod</code> key in the <code>input</code> section of the config.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>To find an XKB name for a particular key, you may use a program like <code>wev</code>.</p> <p>Open it from a terminal and press the key that you want to detect. In the terminal, you will see output like this:</p> <pre><code>[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757775; time: 44940343; key: 113; state: 1 (pressed)\n                      sym: Left         (65361), utf8: ''\n[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757776; time: 44940432; key: 113; state: 0 (released)\n                      sym: Left         (65361), utf8: ''\n[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757777; time: 44940753; key: 114; state: 1 (pressed)\n                      sym: Right        (65363), utf8: ''\n[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757778; time: 44940846; key: 114; state: 0 (released)\n                      sym: Right        (65363), utf8: ''\n</code></pre> <p>Here, look at <code>sym: Left</code> and <code>sym: Right</code>: these are the key names. I was pressing the left and the right arrow in this example.</p> <p>Keep in mind that binding shifted keys requires spelling out Shift and the unshifted version of the key, according to your XKB layout. For example, on the US QWERTY layout, &lt; is on Shift + ,, so to bind it, you spell out something like <code>Mod+Shift+Comma</code>.</p> <p>As another example, if you've configured the French B\u00c9PO XKB layout, your &lt; is on AltGr + \u00ab. AltGr is <code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code>, or equivalently <code>Mod5</code>, so to bind it, you spell out something like <code>Mod+Mod5+guillemotleft</code>.</p> <p>When resolving latin keys, niri will search for the first configured XKB layout that has the latin key. So for example with US QWERTY and RU layouts configured, US QWERTY will be used for latin binds.</p> <p>Since: 0.1.8 Binds will repeat by default (i.e. holding down a bind will make it trigger repeatedly). You can disable that for specific binds with <code>repeat=false</code>:</p> <pre><code>binds {\n    Mod+T repeat=false { spawn \"alacritty\"; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Binds can also have a cooldown, which will rate-limit the bind and prevent it from repeatedly triggering too quickly.</p> <pre><code>binds {\n    Mod+T cooldown-ms=500 { spawn \"alacritty\"; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is mostly useful for the scroll bindings.</p>"},{"location":"Configuration%3A-Key-Bindings.html#scroll-bindings","title":"Scroll Bindings","text":"<p>You can bind mouse wheel scroll ticks using the following syntax.

Touchpad scrolling is continuous, so for these binds it is split into discrete intervals based on distance travelled.</p> <p>These binds are also affected by touchpad's <code>natural-scroll</code>, so these example binds are \"inverted\", since niri has <code>natural-scroll</code> enabled for touchpads by default.</p> <pre><code>binds {\n    Mod+TouchpadScrollDown { spawn \"wpctl\" \"set-volume\" \"@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@\" \"0.02+\"; }\n    Mod+TouchpadScrollUp   { spawn \"wpctl\" \"set-volume\" \"@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@\" \"0.02-\"; }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Both mouse wheel and touchpad scroll binds will prevent applications from receiving any scroll events when their modifiers are held down.

Is it really that... time again?</p> <p>A compositor deals with one or more monitors on mostly fixed refresh cycles. For example, a 170\u00a0Hz monitor can draw a frame every ~5.88\u00a0ms.</p> <p>Most of the time, the compositor doesn't actually redraw the monitor: when nothing changes on screen (e.g. you're reading a document and aren't moving your cursor), it would be wasteful to wake up the GPU to composite the same image. During an animation however, screen contents do change every frame. Niri will generally start drawing the next frame as soon as the previous one shows up on screen.</p> <p>Since the monitor refresh cycle is fixed in most cases (even with VRR, there's a maximum refresh rate), the compositor can predict when the next frame will show up on the monitor, and render ongoing animations for that exact moment in time. This way, all animation frames are perfectly timed with no jitter, regardless of when exactly the rendering code had a chance to run. For example, even if the compositor has to process new window events, delaying the rendering by a few ms, the animation timing will remain exactly aligned to the monitor refresh cycle.</p> <p>There are hence several properties that a compositor wants from its timing system.</p> <ol> <li>It should be possible to get the state of the animations at a specific time in the near future, for rendering a frame exactly timed to when the monitor will show it.<ul> <li>This time override ability should be usable in tests to advance the time in a fully controlled fashion.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Animations in response to user actions should begin at the moment when the action happens.    For example, pressing a workspace switch key should start the animation at the instant when the user pressed the key (rather than, say, slightly in the future where we predicted the next monitor frame, which we had already rendered by now).</li> <li>During the processing of a single action, querying the current time should return the exact same value.    Even if the processing finishes a few microseconds after it started, querying the time in the end should return the same thing.    This generally makes writing code much more sane; otherwise you'd need to for example avoid reading the position of some element twice in a row, since it could have moved by one pixel in-between, screwing with the logic.    Also, fetching the current system time can be quite expensive in terms of overhead.</li> <li>It should be reasonably easy to implement an animation slow-down preference, so all animations can be slowed down or sped up by the same factor.</li> </ol> <p>The solution in niri is a <code>LazyClock</code>, a clock that remembers one timestamp. Initially, the timestamp is empty, so when you ask <code>LazyClock</code> for the current time, it will fetch and return the system time, and also remember it. Subsequently, it will keep returning the same timestamp that it had remembered.</p> <p>You can also clear the timestamp, then <code>LazyClock</code> will fetch the system time anew when it's needed. In niri, the timestamp is cleared at the end of every event loop iteration, right before going to sleep waiting for new events. This way, anything that happens next (like a user key press) will fetch and use the most up-to-date timestamp as soon as one is needed, but then the processing code will keep getting the exact same timestamp, since <code>LazyClock</code> stores it.</p> <p>You can also just manually set the timestamp to a specific value. This is how we render a frame for the predicted time of when the monitor will show it. Also, this is used by tests: they simply always set the timestamp and never use the system time.</p> <p>Finally, there's an <code>AdjustableClock</code> wrapper on top that provides the ability to control the slow-down rate by modifying the timestamps returned by the clock.</p> <p>An important detail is that with rate changes, timestamps from the <code>AdjustableClock</code> will drift away and become unrelated to the system time. However, our target timestamp (for rendering) comes from the system time, so the override works directly on the underlying <code>LazyClock</code>. That is, overriding the timestamp and then querying the <code>AdjustableClock</code> will return a different timestamp that is correct and consistent with the adjustments made by <code>AdjustableClock</code>. This is reflected in the API by naming the function <code>Clock::set_unadjusted()</code> (and there's also <code>Clock::now_unadjusted()</code> to get the raw timestamp).</p> <p>The clock is shared among all animations in niri through passing around and storing a reference-counted pointer. This way, overriding the time automatically applies to everything, whereas in tests we can use a separate clock per test so that they don't interfere with each other.</p>"},{"location":"Development%3A-Design-Principles.html","title":"Design Principles","text":""},{"location":"Development%3A-Design-Principles.html#general-principles","title":"General principles","text":"<p>These are some of the general principles that I try to follow throughout niri.

Wayland clients mostly work in the logical space, and it's the most convenient space to do all the layout in, since it bakes in the output scaling factor.</p> <p>However, many things need to be sized or positioned at integer physical coordinates. For example, Wayland toplevel buffers are assumed to be placed at an integer physical pixel on an output (and <code>WaylandSurfaceRenderElement</code> will do that for you). Borders and focus rings should also have a width equal to an integer number of physical pixels to stay crisp (not to mention that <code>SolidColorRenderElement</code> does not anti-alias lines at fractional pixel positions).</p> <p>Integer physical coordinates do not necessarily correspond to integer logical coordinates though. Even with an integer scale = 2, a physical pixel at (1, 1) will be at the logical position of (0.5, 0.5). This problem becomes much worse with fractional scale factors where most integer logical coordinates will fall on fractional physical coordinates.</p> <p>Thus, niri uses fractional logical coordinates for most of its layout. However, one needs to be very careful to keep things aligned to the physical grid to avoid artifacts like:</p> <ul> <li>Border width alternating 1 px thicker/thinner</li> <li>Border showing 1 px off from the window at certain positions</li> <li>1 px gaps around rounded corners</li> <li>Slightly blurry window contents during resizes</li> <li>And so on...</li> </ul> <p>The way it's handled in niri is:</p> <ol> <li> <p>All relevant sizes on a workspace are rounded to an integer physical coordinate according to the current output scale. Things like struts, gaps, border widths, working area location.</p> <p>It's important to understand that they remain fractional numbers in the logical space, but these numbers correspond to an integer number of pixels in the physical space. The rounding looks something like: <code>(logical_size * scale).round() / scale</code>. Whenever a workspace moves to an output with a different scale (or the output scale changes), all sizes are re-rounded from their original configured values to align with the new physical space.</p> </li> <li> <p>The view offset and individual column/tile render offsets are not rounded to physical pixels, but:</p> </li> <li><code>tiles_with_render_positions()</code> rounds tile positions to physical pixels as it returns them,</li> <li>Custom shaders like opening, closing and resizing windows, are also careful to keep positions and sizes rounded to the physical pixels.</li> </ol> <p>The idea is that every tile can assume that it is rendered at an integer physical coordinate, therefore when shifting the position by, say, border width (also rounded to integer physical coordinates), the new position will stay rounded to integer physical coordinates. The same logic works for the rest of the layout thanks to gaps, struts and working area being similarly rounded. This way, the entire layout is always aligned, as long as it is positioned at an integer physical coordinate (which rounding the tile positions effectively achieves).</p>"},{"location":"Development%3A-Redraw-Loop.html","title":"Redraw Loop","text":"<p>On a TTY, only one frame can be submitted to an output at a time, and the compositor must wait until the output repaints (indicated by a VBlank) to be able to submit the next frame.

Any operation that may cause the screen to update calls <code>queue_redraw()</code>, which moves the output to a <code>Queued</code> state. Then, at the end of an event loop dispatch, niri calls <code>redraw()</code> for every <code>Queued</code> output.</p> <p>If the redraw causes damage (i.e. something on the output changed), we move into the <code>WaitingForVBlank</code> state, since we cannot redraw until we receive a VBlank event.

Instead, we set a timer to fire roughly at when the next VBlank would occur, and transition to a <code>WaitingForEstimatedVBlank</code> state.</p> <p>This is necessary in order to throttle frame callbacks sent to applications to at most once per output refresh cycle. Without this throttling, applications can start continuously redrawing without damage (for instance, if the application window is partially off-screen, and it is only the off-screen part that changes), and eating a lot of CPU in the process.</p> <p>Then, either the estimated VBlank timer completes, and we go back to <code>Idle</code>, or maybe we call <code>queue_redraw()</code> once more and try to redraw again.</p>"},{"location":"Example-systemd-Setup.html","title":"Example systemd Setup","text":"<p>When starting niri from a display manager like GDM, or otherwise through the <code>niri-session</code> binary, it runs as a systemd service.
