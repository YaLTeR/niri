<!-- Please describe the issue here at the top, then fill in the system information below. -->

<!-- Attaching your full niri config can help diagnose the problem. -->

<!--
If you have a problem with a specific app, please verify that it is running on Wayland, rather than X11. An easy way is to run xeyes and mouse over the app: xeyes will be able to "see" only X11 windows.

You can also check what process the window PID belongs to:

$ readlink /proc/$(niri msg --json pick-window | jq .pid)/exe

If this points to xwayland-satellite, then it's an X11 window.

Please report issues with X11 apps to xwayland-satellite instead of niri: https://github.com/Supreeeme/xwayland-satellite/issues
