### Overview

<sup>Since: 25.01</sup>

Layer rules let you adjust behavior for individual layer-shell surfaces.
They have `match` and `exclude` directives that control which layer-shell surfaces the rule should apply to, and a number of properties that you can set.

Layer rules are processed and work very similarly to window rules, just with different matchers and properties.
Please read the [window rules wiki page](./Configuration:-Window-Rules.md) to learn how matching works.

Here are all matchers and properties that a layer rule could have:

```kdl
layer-rule {
    match namespace="waybar"
    match at-startup=true
    match layer="top"

    // Properties that apply continuously.
    opacity 0.5
    block-out-from "screencast"
    // block-out-from "screen-capture"

    shadow {
        on
        // off
        softness 40
        spread 5
        offset x=0 y=5
        draw-behind-window true
        color "#00000064"
        // inactive-color "#00000064"
    }

    geometry-corner-radius 12
    place-within-backdrop true
    baba-is-float true

    background-effect {
        xray true
        blur true
        noise 0.05
        saturation 3
    }

    popups {
        opacity 0.5
        geometry-corner-radius 6

        background-effect {
            xray true
            blur true
            noise 0.05
            saturation 3
        }
    }
}
```

### Layer Surface Matching

Let's look at the matchers in more detail.

#### `namespace`

This is a regular expression that should match anywhere in the surface namespace.
You can read about the supported regular expression syntax [here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).

```kdl
// Match surfaces with namespace containing "waybar",
layer-rule {
    match namespace="waybar"
}
```

You can find the namespaces of all open layer-shell surfaces by running `niri msg layers`.

#### `at-startup`

Can be `true` or `false`.
Matches during the first 60 seconds after starting niri.

```kdl
// Show layer-shell surfaces with 0.5 opacity at niri startup, but not afterwards.
layer-rule {
    match at-startup=true

    opacity 0.5
}
```

#### `layer`

<sup>Since: 26.04</sup>

Matches surfaces on this layer-shell layer.
Can be `"background"`, `"bottom"`, `"top"`, or `"overlay"`.

```kdl
// Make all overlay-layer surfaces FLOAT.
layer-rule {
    match layer="overlay"

    baba-is-float true
}
```

### Dynamic Properties

These properties apply continuously to open layer-shell surfaces.

#### `block-out-from`

You can block out surfaces from xdg-desktop-portal screencasts or all screen captures.
They will be replaced with solid black rectangles.

This can be useful for notifications.

The same caveats and instructions apply as for the [`block-out-from` window rule](./Configuration:-Window-Rules.md#block-out-from), so check the documentation there.

![Screenshot showing a notification visible normally, but blocked out on OBS.](./img/layer-block-out-from-screencast.png)

```kdl
// Block out mako notifications from screencasts.
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^notifications$"

    block-out-from "screencast"
}
```

#### `opacity`

Set the opacity of the surface.
`0.0` is fully transparent, `1.0` is fully opaque.
This is applied on top of the surface's own opacity, so semitransparent surfaces will become even more transparent.

Opacity is applied to every child of the layer-shell surface individually, so subsurfaces and pop-up menus will show window content behind them.

```kdl
// Make fuzzel semitransparent.
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^launcher$"

    opacity 0.95
}
```

#### `shadow`

<sup>Since: 25.02</sup>

Override the shadow options for the surface.

These rules have the same options as the normal [`shadow` config in the layout section](./Configuration:-Layout.md#shadow), so check the documentation there.

Unlike window shadows, layer surface shadows always need to be enabled with a layer rule.
That is, enabling shadows in the layout config section won't automatically enable them for layer surfaces.

> [!NOTE]
> Layer surfaces have no way to tell niri about their *visual geometry*.
> For example, if a layer surface includes some invisible margins (like mako), niri has no way of knowing that, and will draw the shadow behind the entire surface, including the invisible margins.
>
> So to use niri shadows, you'll need to configure layer-shell clients to remove their own margins or shadows.

```kdl
// Add a shadow for fuzzel.
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^launcher$"

    shadow {
        on
    }

    // Fuzzel defaults to 10 px rounded corners.
    geometry-corner-radius 10
}
```

#### `geometry-corner-radius`

<sup>Since: 25.02</sup>

Set the corner radius of the surface.

This setting will only affect the shadow—it will round its corners to match the geometry corner radius.

```kdl
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^launcher$"

    geometry-corner-radius 12
}
```

#### `geometry-corner-radius-exponent`

<sup>Since: next release</sup>

Sets the exponent used for corner rounding, using the superellipse equation `x^n + y^n = 1`.

- 2 is the default circular rounding.
- Values greater than 2 produce "squircle" corners.
- Values closer to 1 produce chamfer-like corners.

```kdl
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^launcher$"

    geometry-corner-radius 12
    geometry-corner-radius-exponent 4
}
```

#### `place-within-backdrop`

<sup>Since: 25.05</sup>

Set to `true` to place the surface into the backdrop visible in the [Overview](./Overview.md) and between workspaces.

This will only work for *background* layer surfaces that ignore exclusive zones (typical for wallpaper tools).
Layers within the backdrop will ignore all input.

```kdl
// Put swaybg inside the overview backdrop.
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^wallpaper$"

    place-within-backdrop true
}
```

#### `baba-is-float`

<sup>Since: 25.05</sup>

Make your layer surfaces FLOAT up and down.

This is a natural extension of the [April Fools' 2025 feature](./Configuration:-Window-Rules.md#baba-is-float).

```kdl
// Make fuzzel FLOAT.
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^launcher$"

    baba-is-float true
}
```

#### `background-effect`

<sup>Since: 26.04</sup>

Override the background effect options for this surface.

- `xray`: set to `true` to enable the xray effect, or `false` to disable it.
- `blur`: set to `true` to enable blur behind this surface, or `false` to force-disable it.
- `noise`: amount of pixel noise added to the background (helps with color banding from blur).
- `saturation`: color saturation of the background (`0` is desaturated, `1` is normal, `2` is 200% saturation).

See the [window effects page](./Window-Effects.md) for an overview of background effects.

```kdl
// Make top and overlay layers use the regular blur (if enabled),
// while bottom and background layers keep using the efficient xray blur.
layer-rule {
    match layer="top"
    match layer="overlay"

    background-effect {
        xray false
    }
}
```

#### `popups`

<sup>Since: 26.04</sup>

Override properties for this layer surface's pop-ups (e.g. a menu opened by clicking an item in Waybar).

The properties work the same way as the corresponding layer-rule properties, except that they apply to the layer surface's pop-ups rather than to the layer surface itself.

`opacity` is applied *on top* of the layer surface's own opacity rule, so setting both will make pop-ups more transparent than the surface.
Other properties apply independently.

> [!NOTE]
> This block affects only pop-ups created by the app via Wayland's [xdg-popup](https://wayland.app/protocols/xdg-shell#xdg_popup) (which should be most of them).
>
> Some desktop shells will emulate pop-ups by drawing something that looks like a pop-up inside a regular layer surface.
> As far as niri is concerned, those are just layer surfaces and not pop-ups, so this block won't apply to them.
>
> This block also does not affect input-method pop-ups, such as Fcitx.

```kdl
// Blur the background behind Waybar popup menus.
layer-rule {
    match namespace="^waybar$"

    popups {
        // Match the default GTK 3 popup corner radius.
        geometry-corner-radius 6
        opacity 0.85

        background-effect {
            blur true
        }
    }
}
```

Keep in mind that the background effect will look right only if the pop-up is shaped like a (rounded) rectangle, and the layer surface correctly sets its Wayland geometry to exclude any shadows.
Pop-ups with custom shapes will need the app to implement the [ext-background-effect protocol](https://wayland.app/protocols/ext-background-effect-v1) to work properly.
