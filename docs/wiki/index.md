Welcome to the niri wiki!

Check out the available pages on the right.

The wiki is open to contribution, but please discuss bigger changes in [our Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#niri:matrix.org) first! The wiki is generated from files in the `wiki/` folder of the repository, so you can open a pull request modifying it there.
